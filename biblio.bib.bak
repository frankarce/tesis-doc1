  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present an Adaptive Educational Hypermedia prototype, named INSPIRE. The approach employed in INSPIRE emphasizes the fact that learners perceive and process information in very different ways, and integrates ideas from theories of instructional design and learning styles. Our aim is to make a shift towards a more 'learning-focused' paradigm of instruction by providing a sequence of authentic and meaningful tasks that matches learner' preferred way of studying. INSPIRE, throughout its interaction with the learner, dynamically generates learner-tailored lessons that gradually lead to the accomplishment of learner's learning goals. It supports several levels of adaptation: from full system-control to full learner-control, and offers learners the option to decide on the level of adaptation of the system by intervening in different stages of the lesson generation process and formulating the lesson contents and presentation. Both the adaptive and adaptable behavior of INSPIRE are guided by the learner model which provides information about the learner, such as knowledge level on the domain concepts and learning style. The learner model is exploited in multiple ways: curriculum sequencing, adaptive navigation support, adaptive presentation, and supports system's adaptable behavior. An empirical study has been performed to evaluate the adaptation framework and assess learners' attitudes towards the proposed instructional design.},

  Abstract                 = { We argue in this paper is that there is a lack of clarity about learning in its broadest form, and we address this by proposing a generalised and integrated conceptual framework for learning. The Learning Environment, Learning Processes and Learning Outcomes (LEPO) framework conceptualises learning as having three components: the environment which facilitates learning (Learning Environment), the activities which are part of learning (Learning Processes) and the knowledge, behaviours, skills or understanding which can be demonstrated (Learning Outcomes). Two general actors interact with these three components, the student and the teacher. The paper discusses the origins of the framework, justifies its form and validates it against other conceptual frameworks. It concludes with a brief discussion about how it can be used to improve both the educational design of educational innovations and evaluate/ research into the effectiveness of educational innovations. },

The terms Learning Objects (LOs) and Reusable Learning Objects are frequently employed in uncritical ways, thereby reducing them to mere slogans. The serious lack of conceptual clarity and reflection is evident in the multitude of definitions and uses of LOs. The objectives of this paper are to assess current definitions of the term Learning Object, to articulate the foundational principles for developing a concept of LOs, and to provide a methodology and broad set of guidelines for creating LOs.},
